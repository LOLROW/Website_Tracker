# Website_Tracker
Basic website tracker spyware.

No need to port forward because of Scapy. This works by forcing the target computer to send ICMP packets whenever it accesses or sends a request on the monitored websites.
This should only be used for educational purposes only. It doesn't have any way to hide itself for a reason.
